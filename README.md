Is a program to collect data from user and save it as csv files, it could be any file but in this repository I am using CSV as example.
In a brief: I used two modules the Tkinter to build the app and Panda to create a dataframe and then save as CSV file.
Additionally I used pure python to create functions
What is the idea of this project?
This is useful for data analysis, why?, because people who get the data can ask them and enter them as csv file simultanously and then show it to
data scientists.
